## Overview:
This project involved the development of a robust RESTful API using Node.js and implementing various features like unit and integration testing, token-based authentication, and BCrypt password hashing schemes. The project also involved the construction of an efficient bootstrapping database using PostgreSQL and ORM frameworks like Sequelize, along with the implementation of continuous integration using Git Version Control. Finally, the application was deployed on the AWS cloud using Terraform, Packer, Docker, and Shell Scripting with Amazon Linux 2, and automation of the entire application was done, including the daemonization of processes and deployment through CI/CD, ensuring high availability and uptime.
